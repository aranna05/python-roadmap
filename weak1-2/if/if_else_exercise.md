## Exercise: Python If Condition

1. Write a program that takes an integer as input from the user and prints whether the number is "Even" or "Odd".

2. Write a program that takes a student's score (an integer between 0 and 100) as input and prints their letter grade based on the following scale:
 ```
90-100: A
80-89: B
70-79: C
60-69: D
Below 60: F 
```

3. Write a program that checks a user's age and whether they have a license (a boolean variable) to determine their driving eligibility. 
   1. If they are under 18, print "Too young to drive."
   2. If they are 18 or over and have a license, print "You are eligible to drive."
   3. If they are 18 or over but don't have a license, print "You must have a license to drive." 
4. Using following list of cities per country,
    ```
    india = ["mumbai", "banglore", "chennai", "delhi"]
    pakistan = ["lahore","karachi","islamabad"]
    bangladesh = ["dhaka", "khulna", "rangpur"]
    ```
    1. Write a program that asks user to enter a city name and it should tell which country the city belongs to
    2. Write a program that asks user to enter two cities and it tells you if they both are in same country or not. For example if I enter mumbai and chennai, it will print "Both cities are in India" but if I enter mumbai and dhaka it should print "They don't belong to same country"
5. Write a python program that can tell you if your sugar is normal or not. Normal fasting level sugar range is 80 to 100.
    1. Ask user to enter his fasting sugar level
